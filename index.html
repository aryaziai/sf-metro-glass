						Metropolitan Glass Company was established in 1986 in San Francisco as a full service glass shop,
						providing glass replacement and new installation service for commercial and residential projects,
						gradually specializing in commercial contract glazing projects.
						Incorporated in 1989 as a C Corp., we further specialized and expanded our ability to perform on
						commercial contract glazing projects and since then have successfully completed hundreds of projects.
						Photos of some of these projects are in our photo gallery for your viewing.
